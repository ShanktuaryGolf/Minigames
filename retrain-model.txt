Perfect! I've created retrain-empirical-model.js - a standalone script that contains the complete retraining process:

  📝 Saved: retrain-empirical-model.js

  What it does:
  1. Loads all shots from all-shots.csv
  2. Groups shots by region (WEDGE, IRON, POWER, DRIVER)
  3. Optimizes coefficients via least-squares grid search
  4. Tests the model and reports accuracy
  5. Outputs formatted coefficients ready to copy into the game files

  How to use it:
  node retrain-empirical-model.js

  Output includes:
  - Region breakdown (shot counts)
  - Optimized coefficients for each region
  - Test results (passing rate, average error)
  - Formatted coefficient code ready to copy/paste into:
    - empirical-golf-model.js
    - golf-par3.html
    - homerun-derby.html

  The script is completely self-contained - it has all the logic for:
  - Loading CSV data
  - Region classification
  - Grid search optimization
  - Model testing
  - Formatted output

  You can run this anytime you add new shots to all-shots.csv to retrain the model, even if this session gets disconnected!
