 Hey everyone! 👋

  If you've got a golf simulator with a launch monitor, I've built something you might enjoy - Shanktuary Golf Mini Games!

  What is it?
  It's a free app that connects to your launch monitor (via GSPro Open Connect - TCP 921) and lets you play arcade-style mini games using
   your actual golf shots. Think of it as turning your sim into a full game room!

  🎮 Games Included:

  🎳 Bowling (NEWEST - v3.6.0)
  - Full 10-frame regulation bowling with strikes & spares
  - Realistic pin physics (they actually knock each other down!)
  - Per-player bumpers for kids
  - Power boost options for slower swing speeds
  - Automatic pin camera that shows the collision
  - Hit putter shots: speed = power, HLA = aim, spin = hook

  ⚾ Baseball (3 Modes!)
  - Practice Mode - Free swinging with stats
  - Home Run Derby - 10 strikes, longest drive tracking
  - 9-Inning Game - Full baseball with base runners!
  - MLB-sized stadium, realistic hit distances

  🎯 Darts (5 Game Modes!)
  - Practice, 301, 501, Cricket, Killer
  - 1-6 players, projector mode
  - Calibration wizard for accuracy
  - Great for wedge practice!

  ⛳ Putting Practice (2 Modes!)
  - Practice Mode - 1-40ft putts, adjustable stimp/break/slope
  - Ladder Mode - Progressive training (2ft → 40ft)
  - Real Stanford physics for realistic roll
  - Topographical grid shows break direction

  🔌 How It Works:
  Connects to GSPro Open Connect (TCP 921) - if your LM can talk to GSPro, it can play these games!

  Compatible with:
  Mevo+, SkyTrak, GCQuad, Bushnell Launch Pro, Uneekor, FlightScope, etc.

  Works even if GSPro isn't running! Just needs port 921 active.
