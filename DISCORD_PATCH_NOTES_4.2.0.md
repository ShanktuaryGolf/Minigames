# Shanktuary Golf Mini Games - Version 4.2.0

## What's New

### Course Expansion: Hole 4 Complete!
- **New Par 4, 395 yards** - Our first dogleg right hole
- **Mitten-shaped fairway** with strategic design
- **Water hazard system** - Avoid the pond on the right side
- **Oval-shaped green** for added challenge

### FlightScope-Calibrated Ball Physics
The ball flight physics have been completely recalibrated using real-world **FlightScope trajectory data**:
- Tested across three ball speeds: **55 mph, 130 mph, and 175 mph**
- Accuracy within **±2 yards** of real-world data across all speeds
- Realistic carry and roll distances for every shot
- Proper soft-landing rollout behavior with backspin

### Green Slope Physics
Greens now have **realistic 3D slopes**:
- Ball curves naturally based on green slope
- Gravity-based physics for authentic putting feel
- Each hole features unique slope characteristics
- Read the green carefully for successful putting

## Technical Improvements
- Enhanced water hazard detection system
- Optimized drag coefficients for accurate ball flight
- Improved spin friction and rollout calculations
- Production-ready build with debug features removed
